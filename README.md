            ◦ The higher price category a seat belongs to the better its location is. 
        ◦ If two seats fall in the same price category, the order of section preference prevails: The most popular section is the stalls, then the centre of the gallery, followed by the left and right sides of the gallery (identical preference) and lastly, the boxes (identical preference).
        ◦ In the event two or more seats are in the same section and in the same price category, the one(s) in the row closer to the stage is (are) considered better.
        ◦ If two or more seats are in the same row, the one(s) in the centre is (are) preferred. 
    • The expected outcome is an alternative that meets the requirements according to the given specifications of section, row, and seat numbers (the seat numbers in the rows are shown in the attached illustration; the row numbers start from the stage, and the rows of each section are numbered from 1).
    • If you have more than one alternatives that meet the requirements, any of them is accepted as a solution.
